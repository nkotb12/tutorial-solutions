        "1. To illustrate the difference between testing and debugging. In SWEN90006, we cover testing, but not debugging. As part of this exercise, we did debugging to determine where the fault is.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. To clarify the terminology of faults, failures, and errors. Faults and failures are quite often confused, and importantly, the term \"bugs\" is used to mean both. In SWEN90006, the term \"bugs\" is disallowed due to its ambiguity.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. To illustrate an important point about coverage-based testing (which we will cover later in the subject): just executing every statement of a program is a *necessary but not sufficient* condition for a good test suite. It is not only possible to execute a statement but not trigger an error, but to trigger an error that does NOT result in a failure.\n",
        "\n",
        "  These cases are known as *coincidental correctness*, and are exceedingly common in real-world software."
